# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information.
#
# The local strategy for options in sshd_config is to
# remove commented lines when we override values.
# This strategy is intended to...
#
# * Promote unique lines in the config to
#   avoid accidental conflicts or duplicates.
# * Promote clarity.
#
# The upstream strategy for options in sshd_config
# shipped with OpenSSH is to...
#
# * Specify options with their default value where possible,
#   but leave them commented.
# * Uncommented options change a default value.

# CCE-14491-5 Use appropriate ciphers for SSH
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-13
#
# Enforce the use of ciphers which are FIPS-approved.
#
# The default is:
#   aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
#   aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,

# CCE-4325-7 Disable SSH protocol version 1

# Disable legacy (protocol version 1) support in the server for new

# CCE-4370-3 Disable SSH host-based authentication
# NIST 800-53 mapping: CM-7
#
# Prevent hosts from unilaterally trusting one another,

#
# The default is 'no'.
#
HostbasedAuthentication no





# CCE-4475-0 Disable emulation of the rsh command through the ssh server
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-7
#
# Prevent SSH from emulating the behavior of the obsolete rsh
# command, which would allow users to enable insecure access to
# their accounts via .rhosts files.
#
# Don't read the user's ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
#
# The default is 'yes'.

IgnoreRhosts yes




# CCE-3660-8 Disable remote connections from accounts with empty passwords
# NIST 800-53 mapping: AC-17, SC-7
#
# Prevent users with blank passwords from accessing the system remotely.
# All user accounts should have complex passwords that meet password requirements.
#
# The default is 'no'.
#
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no

GSSAPIAuthentication no
KerberosAuthentication no

# "no" means disable s/key passwords.
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no




# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin without-password".
#
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.

# CCE-3845-5 idle timeout interval should be set to an appropriate value
# NIST 800-53 mapping: CM-7, AC-11
#
# Per CCE: An idle user should be automatically logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity.
# This prevents the system from keeping open ssh connections that are not being used.
#
# Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has
# been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through
# the encrypted channel to request a response from the client.
#
# The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.
#
# Recommended by CCE: 900
#
ClientAliveInterval 900



# CCE-14061-6 'keep alive' message count should be set to an appropriate value.
# NIST 800-53 mapping: SC-10
#
# Per CCE: An idle user should be automatically logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity.
# This prevents the system from keeping open ssh connections that are not being used.
#
# The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server
# depend on knowing when a connection has become inactive.
# If ClientAliveInterval (see above) is set to 15, and
# ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH
# clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.
#
# The default value is 3.
#
# Recommended by CCE: 0
#
ClientAliveCountMax 0



# CCE-4431-3 SSH warning banner should be enabled
# NIST 800-53 mapping: AC-3, CM-6, AC-8
#
# Users should see a message before they the logon process.
#
# The contents of the specified file are sent to the remote user
# before authentication is allowed.
# If the argument is 'none' then no banner is displayed.

# Default: none

# Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the remote host name
# and check that the resolved host name for the remote IP address
# maps back to the very same IP address.
UseDNS yes




# CCE-4387-7 Disable root login via SSH
# NIST 800-53 mapping: AC-17, SC-7
#
# Prevent the root user from logging in directly over the
# network. It reduces auditable information about who ran privileged
# commands on the system and allows direct attack attempts on
# root's password
#
# The default is 'yes'.
#
# Recommended: 'no'
#
permitrootlogin no




# CCE-14716-5 Users should not be allowed to set environment options
# NIST 800-53 mapping: CM-7
#
# Prevents user from being able to present environment
# options to the SSH daemon and potentially bypass some access
# restrictions using mechanisms such as LD_PRELOAD.
#
# Prevent sshd(8) from procesesing:
# * ~/.ssh/environment
# environment= options in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#
# The default is 'no'.
