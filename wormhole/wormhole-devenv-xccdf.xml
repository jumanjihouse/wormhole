      This profile adjusts the common profile for wormhole devenv containers.

      We pre-define a set of tailoring actions to be applied on top of
      or instead of the tailoring performed by the scap-security-guide
      benchmark's profiles. This is necessary to adjust the benchmark
      to our local needs.

    <select idref="disable_prelink" selected="false">
      <remark>
        We don't even have prelink package, so the upstream check
        for its configuration is defective. However, we still want
        to prevent prelink, so we have separate rspec to check that
        prelink is not installed.

        I don't know why oscap skips this test.
        I still want to check that /etc/securetty is zero-length,
        so we have an rspec check for it.

        It does not make sense to run ntpd inside a container, so
        we disable this check.

        Upstream checks for a 5-minute idle timeout, but
        we currently allow a 15-minute idle timeout.
